# agriculture_production_analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing state-wise crop production data in India. The goal is to compute the total production for various crops across different states and identify the highest-producing states for key crops such as rice. Using Python's **Pandas** for data manipulation and **Matplotlib** for visualization, the project also explores trends and provides insights into crop production patterns.

## Key Features
1. Data Cleaning & Aggregation:
   - The dataset is cleaned and indexed based on unique states and crops.
   - Conditional filtering is applied to isolate specific crops, such as rice, for further analysis.
   - Grouped data by state and year to compute total crop production.
2. Data Visualization:
   - Visualized state-wise crop production using bar charts to identify top-producing states.
   - Aggregated crop production trends are analyzed on an annual and state basis.
   - Scatter plots and histograms are used to explore distribution and relationships between crop types and production.
4. Analysis Tasks:
   - Identified the most common crop produced in India.
   - Determined the state with the highest rice production since 1998.
   - Analyzed top five states in terms of total crop production for specific years.
